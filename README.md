# PyBer_Analysis.
In this challenge we will be anlayzing rideshare data by performaing exploratory analysis and using data visualization methods such as pandas and matplotlib to access the variation of ride share services in urban, suburban and rural cities in order to make informed decisions at Pyber.

#**Results**

The Reults from the PyBer Summary DataFrame outlines the disparity of PyBer's ridesharing services in the three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban. 
The summary shows that there is a larger demand for Pyber services in urban communities compared to suburban and rural cities. The pies charts and summary DataFrame support this eveidence based on the following categories: total fares, total rides and total drivers in each of these cities.

 **Total Fares**
 This pie chart shows that the majority of total fares are coming from the urban city(approx 63%) wheras the rural city makes up less than 10%.
 
 **Total Rides**
 This pie chart shows that a significant number of rides are demanded in the urban city(approx 70%) wheras the rural city demand is less than 6%
 
 **Total Drivers**
 This Pie chart also shows that there is a significant demand in the number of drivers (over 80%) in the urban community versus the rural city(less than 3%)
 
 **Summary DataFrame**
 The data frame provides a short detailed summary of our findings from the piecharts. However, in terms the average fare per ride the rural community($35) pays approximately $10 more than the urban community($25). Whilst the Suburban community average fare falls in between($31). The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40. Looking at the data obtained from the average fare per ride and average fare per driver the results support the law of supply and demand. Pyber services in the rural community are significantly lower compared to urban and suburban cities but the average fare per driver and ride are significatly higher.
 
 **Multiple-line chart  for the Total Fare by City Type**
 The multiple-line chart provides a visual representation of our findings in the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019. 
 The highest fare revenue (yellow line $2300) in the urban city was observed between February and March whereas the lowest fare revenue($1600) was in January.
 The highest fare revenue (orange line $1400) in the suburban city was observed in February and the lowest fare revenue $750 was in the month of January and April.
 The highest fare revenue (blue line $500) in the rural city was observed in April and the lowest fare revenue $5 was in the month of January.
 One noteworthy peak in total fares among urban, suburban, and rural cities occurred sometime at the end of February where there was a downward trend experienced right after a significant peak period.
 
 **SUMMARY**
*The demand for Pyber services are significant in the urban cities compared to the suburban and rural cities based on the total rides, fares and driver statistics.
 As a result majority of Pyber profits are from Urban cities.
 
*On the other hand, the costs for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban cities. This could discourage potential riders from using PyBer given the high average fare per ride. In addition to this, drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. This could encourage potential drivers to work with PyBer given the high average fare per driver. On the contary the low demand in service would definitely impact the amount of drivers wanting to work at Pyber.

* Pyber should consider doing further analysis to determine what other factors are contributing to high ride cost and determine how they can gain a larger market share in rural cities. Perhaps, by marketing their services more, find a way to lower costs, determine the market risk factors, implement communal ride share options to cut costs.

*Overall, based on our analysis the disparity in PyBer ridersharing services significantly differs in rural, suruban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares.
